# Search Algorithm Implementations  

## Overview  

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental search algorithms commonly used in artificial intelligence and graph theory. The algorithms covered include:  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  
- **Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy BFS)**  
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**  

Each algorithm is implemented with clear and concise code, making it easy to understand, adapt, and extend.

## Algorithms Included  

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:  
   Explores the nearest nodes first before moving to deeper levels, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.  

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:  
   Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. Useful for exhaustive searches.  

3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**:  
   A variant of BFS that takes edge weights into account, finding the least-cost path.  

4. **Greedy Best-First Search (Greedy BFS)**:  
   Chooses nodes based on a heuristic function, aiming for a faster solution at the expense of optimality.  

5. **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**:  
   Combines the benefits of BFS and DFS by gradually increasing the depth limit of the DFS.
